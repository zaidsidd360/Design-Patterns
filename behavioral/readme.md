# Behavioral Design Patterns: 
Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

In these design patterns, the interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled. That means the implementation and the client should be loosely coupled in order to avoid hard coding and dependencies.

## Types of Behavioral Design Patterns: 
- Chain of Responsibility Pattern
- Command Pattern
- Interpreter Pattern
- Iterator Pattern
- Mediator Pattern
- Memento Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- State Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- Template Pattern
- Visitor Pattern
- Null Object
