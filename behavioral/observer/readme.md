# The Observer Design Pattern: 
In Observer pattern, an object, called the <strong>Subject</strong> (aka Publisher), maintains a list of its dependents, called <strong>Observer(s)</strong> (aka Subscriber), and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. It is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such that if the state of one object is modified, all its depenedent objects are notified automatically.
